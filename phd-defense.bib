Richer higher-order and type theories receded into the background, to such an extent that the (re-) discovery of useful and interesting extensions and variations upon first-order logic came as a surprise to many logicians in the sixties.",

	abstract="This chapter presents the multi-resolution analysis theory by formally introducing the contemporary wavelet theories. It starts with formulating a wavelet transform as a transform similar to windowed FT but at multiple resolutions or scales. It then uses the simplest wavelet i.e. Haar wavelet to demonstrate step-by-step how both 1D and 2D discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) work. A 2D wavelet decomposition tree is used to help readers understanding 2D DWT. Readers are then demonstrated with a DWT application on image analysis. By finishing this chapter, readers will have a full understanding how DWT works, what types of features a wavelet can capture and how they can be used for image data mining.",

	Abstract = {Neural network classifiers are known to be able to learn very accurate models. In the recent past, researchers have even been able to train neural networks with multiple hidden layers (deep neural networks) more effectively and efficiently. However, the major downside of neural networks is that it is not trivial to understand the way how they derive their classification decisions. To solve this problem, there has been research on extracting better understandable rules from neural networks. However, most authors focus on nets with only one single hidden layer. The present paper introduces a new decompositional algorithm -- DeepRED -- that is able to extract rules from deep neural networks.}}

	abstract="Connectionist AI systems are large networks of extremely simple numerical processors, massively interconnected and running in parallel. There has been great progress in the connectionist approach, and while it is still unclear whether the approach will succeed, it is also unclear exactly what the implications for cognitive science would be if it did succeed. In this paper I present a view of the connectionist approach that implies that the level of analysis at which uniform formal principles of cognition can be found is the subsymbolic level, intermediate between the neural and symbolic levels. Notions such as logical inference, sequential firing of production rules, spreading activation between conceptual units, mental categories, and frames or schemata turn out to provide approximate descriptions of the coarse-grained behaviour of connectionist systems. The implication is that symbol-level structures provide only approximate accounts of cognition, useful for description but not necessarily for constructing detailed formal models.",

	Abstract = {In this chapter1 we will give an overview of real-life applications developed with constraint logic programming. Constraint logic programming (CLP) combines declarative logic based programming with specialised constraint solving methods from arti{\_}cial intelligence, Operations Research (OR) and mathematics. It allows the clear and concise expression of a wide class of combinatorial problems together with their e{\_}cient solution. In parallel with ongoing research in this field, CLP is now increasingly used to tackle real world decision making problems. In a first part of the chapter, we will briefly present the methods and tools used for CLP and describe typical application areas. We introduce the concepts of global constraints, meta-heuristics and constraint visualisation, which are central to large scale constraint solving.},
